# Code Style Guide

Pyreal uses the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide and [Black formatter ](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)for all python code:

A few important notes:

1. Indents should be 4 spaces, no tabs
2. Lines should be no more than 88 characters long
3. All functions, classes, and methods should have block comment descriptions using the Google docstring format
