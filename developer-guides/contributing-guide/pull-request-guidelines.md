# Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. It resolves an open GitHub Issue and contains its reference in the title or the comment. If there is no associated issue, feel free to create one.
2. Whenever possible, it resolves only **one** issue. If your PR resolves more than one issue, try to split it in more than one pull request.
3. The pull request should include unit tests that cover all the changed code.
4. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the documentation in an appropriate place.
5. The pull request should work for all the supported Python versions. Confirm that all github actions pass.
