    "### Custom Transformers: Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, when defining custom Pyreal transformers, we take the following steps:\n",
    "1. Define the transformer `__init__()` method, using a `super()` call for the parent `Transformer` class. The function can take optional arguments to configure the transformer.\n",
    "2. Define the `data_transform()` function, which takes an input DataFrame `x` and returns `x` after undergoing the transformation.\n",
    "3. Consider the explanation output types you are interested in, and define the appropriate explanation transforms. In the above example, we considered additive local feature contribution and additive global feature importance explanations. We therefore defined the `transform_explanation_additive_feature_contribution` and `transform_explanation_additive_feature_importance` functions.\n",
    "4. [**Advanced Additional Step**]: The explanation transform functions used above are used to transform the explanation to match the feature space resulting from the data transform function. In some cases, like in Pyreal's built-in one-hot encoder transformer, we may want to *undo* the transformation in the explanation. In these cases, we would define `inverse_transform_explanation_XXX` functions. See the Pyreal documentation for more details about this."
