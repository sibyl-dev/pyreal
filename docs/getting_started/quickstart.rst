Quickstart
==========

In this short tutorial we will guide you through a series of steps that will help you
getting started with **Pyreal**.

Get a Feature Contribution Explanation
--------------------------------------
To get a feature contribution explanation of a pre-trained model, we can use the
``LocalFeatureContribution`` class. We begin by loading in the model and transformers.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    import pyreal.applications.titanic as titanic
    from pyreal.transformers import ColumnDropTransformer, MultiTypeImputer

    # Load in data
    x_orig, y = titanic.load_titanic_data()

    # Load in feature descriptions -> dict(feature_name: feature_description, ...)
    feature_descriptions = titanic.load_feature_descriptions()

    # Load in model
    model = titanic.load_titanic_model()

    # Load in list of transformers
    transformers = titanic.load_titanic_transformers()

The ``transformers`` object is a list that includes three types of transformers, specific for this
application:

- ``ColumnDropTransformer``: removes features that should not be used in prediction
- ``MultiTypeImputer``: replaces missing data from all columns with a reasonable replacement
- ``OneHotEncoderWrapper``: one-hot encodes categorical features. We use the built-in wrapper type,
  which includes a ``inverse_transform_explanation`` function.

These transformers transform the data from it's `original` state (``x_orig``) to its
`explanation algorithm ready` state (``x_algorithm``). In this case, the explanation algorithm used expects
data in the `model ready` state (``x_model``), so ``x_algorithm == x_model``.

Next, we can create the ``Explainer`` object, and fit it.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    from pyreal.explainers import LocalFeatureContribution
    lfc = LocalFeatureContribution(model=model, x_train_orig=x_orig,
                                   transformers=transformers,
                                   feature_descriptions=feature_descriptions, fit_on_init=True)
    lfc.fit()

Finally, we can get the explanation using the ``.produce()`` function. We will also visualize
the most contributing features using the `visualize` model.

.. ipython:: python
    :okwarning:

    input_to_explain = x_orig.iloc[0]
    prediction = lfc.model_predict(input_to_explain) # Prediction: [0]

    contributions, x_interpret = lfc.produce(input_to_explain)

    from pyreal.utils import visualize

    # Plot a bar plot of top contributing features, by asbolute value
    visualize.plot_top_contributors(contributions, select_by="absolute", values=x_interpret)

The output will be a bar plot showing the most contributing features, by absolute value.

We can see here that the input passenger's predicted chance of survival was greatly reduced
because of their sex (male) and ticket class (3rd class).
