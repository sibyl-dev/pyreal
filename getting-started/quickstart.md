# Sample application

### Your First Explanation

In this tutorial, we will walk through getting an explanation using a pre-made `RealApp` object on the Titanic dataset. We will explain why a specific passenger is predicted to have survived the sinking of the Titanic.

We start by loading in the pre-made `RealApp` object.

```python
import pyreal.sample_applications.titanic as titanic

real_app = titanic.load_titanic_app()
sample_data = titanic.load_titanic_data(n_rows=300)
```

We can get the model's prediction on a row of data using the `real_app.predict()` function:

<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python"><strong>passenger_id = 1
</strong>predictions = real_app.predict(sample_data)

print("Passenger %s is predicted to have %s" % 
      (passenger_id, ["Died", "Survived"][predictions[passenger_id]]))
      
# OUTPUT: Passenger 1 is predicted to have Survived
</code></pre>

We can can generate explanations using the `produce()` functions. Let's try generating a local feature contribution object, which explains how much each feature value in an input row contributed to the model's prediction:

```python
explanation = real_app.produce_local_feature_contributions(sample_data)
plot_top_contributors(explanation[passenger_id], 
                      prediction=predictions[passenger_id])
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/titanic.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Feature contributions for passenger 1 in the Titanic Dataset. Blue bars indicate and increased prediction of survival, red bars indicate a decreased prediction of survival.</p></figcaption></figure>

We can see here that the fact that this passenger was female and in first class most significantly increased her predicted chance of survival.

### Making a new RealApp

To make a RealApp object for a new application to generate explanations, you will need:

1. A trained model. This can be any object with a `.predict()` function that takes an input and outputs a prediction, such as an sklearn estimator or a pytorch neural network.
2. The training data and targets (in their original format)
3. Any data transformers that prepare the data for predictions, and possibly additional transformers that make the data easier to understand. The [Data Preparation and Modelling](../user-guides/data-preparation-and-modeling/) guides give more details on selecting these transformers.
4. Optionally, a dictionary of default feature names to more descriptive feature strings

```python
import pyreal.applications.titanic as titanic
from pyreal.transformers import ColumnDropTransformer, MultiTypeImputer

# Load in data
x_orig, y = titanic.load_titanic_data()

# Load in feature descriptions -> dict(feature_name: feature_description, ...)
feature_descriptions = titanic.load_feature_descriptions()

# Load in model
model = titanic.load_titanic_model()

# Load in list of transformers
transformers = titanic.load_titanic_transformers()
```

With this information, we can create a RealApp object:

<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python">from pyreal import RealApp

<strong>realApp = RealApp(model, x_orig, y_orig=y,
</strong>                  transformers=transformers,
                  feature_descriptions=feature_descriptions)
</code></pre>

We can now generate and visualize explanations as above:

```python
explanation = real_app.produce_local_feature_contributions(sample_data)
swarm_plot(explanation, type="strip")
```
